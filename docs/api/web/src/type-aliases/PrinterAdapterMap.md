# Type Alias: PrinterAdapterMap

```ts
type PrinterAdapterMap = Readonly<Record<string, PrinterAdapter>>;
```

Map from engine role → PrinterAdapter for a connected device.

Single-engine drivers populate a 1-key record keyed by the engine's
`role` (typically `'primary'`). Multi-engine drivers (LW Duo:
`label` + `tape`) populate one entry per drivable engine. Returned
by each driver-web's `requestPrinters()` factory; the harness shell
reads `printers[selectedRole]` to drive the active section.
