# Interface: PrinterAdapter

High-level printer interface implemented by each driver family.

Consumers (CLIs, label-maker apps, ad-hoc scripts) program against
`PrinterAdapter` and don't need to know which driver is behind it.
Driver-specific features are available by extending this interface
in each `*-node` / `*-web` package.

**Transport serialization contract.** An implementation's
transport-touching methods — `print`, `getStatus`, and any
driver-specific method that issues `transport.write` / `transport.read`
— MUST be mutually serialised: concurrent invocation must never
interleave on the wire. A `print()` is many `transport.write()`
calls, and a `getStatus()` write landing between two of them
corrupts the device's command stream. Consumers may legitimately
call `getStatus()` (e.g. via a status poll) while a `print()` is
in flight, so the driver — the only layer that knows job
boundaries — owns this guarantee. The supported way to satisfy it
is the `WriteSerializer` primitive (`./serializer.ts`): hold one
instance per printer and route every transport-touching method
through `WriteSerializer.run()`.

## Properties

| Property | Modifier | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| <a id="property-connected"></a> `connected` | `readonly` | `boolean` | Whether the printer is currently connected. |
| <a id="property-device"></a> `device?` | `readonly` | [`DeviceEntry`](DeviceEntry.md) | The device entry for the connected printer. Useful for logging, diagnostics, and displaying VID/PID. Undefined if the connection was established without device matching (e.g. a raw TCP connection to a known IP). |
| <a id="property-family"></a> `family` | `readonly` | `string` | Driver family identifier, e.g. `'brother-ql'` or `'labelwriter'`. |
| <a id="property-model"></a> `model` | `readonly` | `string` | Human-readable model name from the driver's device registry. |

## Methods

### close()

```ts
close(): Promise<void>;
```

Close the connection. Always call in `finally` blocks.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`void`\>

***

### createPreview()

```ts
createPreview(image: RawImageData, options?: PreviewOptions): Promise<PreviewResult>;
```

Generate a preview showing how this printer would reproduce the
design on the given media. Returns separated 1bpp planes with
display colours.

The driver uses its own colour-splitting logic (the same code that
`print()` uses internally) to produce the planes. The consuming app
renders whatever planes come back without needing to know the
splitting rules.

For offline preview without a live connection, use the static
`createPreviewOffline()` function exported from the driver's
`*-core` package instead.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `image` | [`RawImageData`](RawImageData.md) | — full RGBA, typically from `designer.render()`. |
| `options?` | [`PreviewOptions`](PreviewOptions.md) | — optional media override. If media is omitted, uses detected media from the last `getStatus()`. If no status is available, the driver defaults to single-colour at the printer's native head width and sets `PreviewResult.assumed = true`. |

#### Returns

`Promise`\<[`PreviewResult`](PreviewResult.md)\>

***

### getStatus()

```ts
getStatus(): Promise<PrinterStatus>;
```

Query printer status including detected media.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<[`PrinterStatus`](PrinterStatus.md)\>

***

### onStatus()?

```ts
optional onStatus(cb: (status: PrinterStatus) => void): () => void;
```

Subscribe to push-based status updates. Drivers whose printers
spontaneously emit status frames (e.g. Brother QL over USB pushes
on lid open/close, media insert, end-of-job, errors) implement
this; consumers that prefer push semantics call this for instant
updates instead of polling `getStatus()` on a timer.

Drivers without push capability leave this undefined; consumers
fall back to periodic `getStatus()` calls.

The driver invokes `cb` for every status frame it receives —
spontaneous ones AND the response to `getStatus()` — so a
subscriber sees both unsolicited events and request-driven
updates. Returns an unsubscribe function.

Implementations are responsible for starting any underlying read
loop on first subscription (or earlier) and stopping it on
`close()`. Errors inside the read loop are reported via the
callback's parent driver layer (e.g. logged); they do not throw
out of `onStatus` after subscription.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type |
| ------ | ------ |
| `cb` | (`status`: [`PrinterStatus`](PrinterStatus.md)) => `void` |

#### Returns

() => `void`

***

### print()

```ts
print(
   image: RawImageData, 
   media?: MediaDescriptor, 
options?: PrintOptions): Promise<void>;
```

Print from a full-colour RGBA image.

The driver converts to its native format internally:

- Single-colour media (`media.palette` undefined) — threshold/dither
  RGBA to a single 1bpp plane via `renderImage`.
- Multi-ink media (`media.palette` defined) — split into planes via
  `renderMultiPlaneImage` using that palette.

**Orientation:** drivers compute the rotation via `pickRotation`
(see `./orientation.ts`) — the input image is treated as the
intended visual; the driver auto-rotates landscape input on media
tagged `defaultOrientation: 'horizontal'`.

**Multi-ink splitting:** the palette on the media descriptor names
every ink the driver should classify pixels into; the contracts
package does not pick "red" or "black" — those facts live with the
media entry.

**Batch printing:** call `print()` once per label. The driver
handles job framing internally (e.g. Brother QL page-break commands
between sequential `print()` calls within the same session).

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| `image` | [`RawImageData`](RawImageData.md) | — full RGBA, typically from `designer.render()`. |
| `media?` | [`MediaDescriptor`](MediaDescriptor.md) | — which media to print on. Determines dimensions, margins, and colour mode. If omitted, uses detected media from the last `getStatus()`. |
| `options?` | [`PrintOptions`](PrintOptions.md) | — per-call options (copies, density, etc.). |

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`void`\>

#### Throws

MediaNotSpecifiedError if no media is known.
