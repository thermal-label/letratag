# Interface: PreviewOptions

Options for `PrinterAdapter.createPreview()`.

Only `media?` is part of the contract — rendering knobs like threshold
and dithering are driver-specific concerns that belong on the driver's
own options, not on this cross-family interface.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| <a id="property-media"></a> `media?` | [`MediaDescriptor`](MediaDescriptor.md) | Override detected media. Use when: - the printer can't detect media (e.g. LabelWriter 450, LabelManager); - designing offline for a specific media type; - testing with a specific media configuration. If omitted, the driver uses detected media from the last `getStatus()`. If no status is available and no override is provided, the driver falls back to single-colour at its native head width and sets `PreviewResult.assumed = true`. |
