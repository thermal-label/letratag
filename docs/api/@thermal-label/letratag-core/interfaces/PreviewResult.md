# Interface: PreviewResult

Result of `PrinterAdapter.createPreview()`.

Contains one `PreviewPlane` per colour the printer would produce,
along with the media that was used (detected, overridden, or defaulted)
and an `assumed` flag indicating whether the preview is based on a
guess.

## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| <a id="property-assumed"></a> `assumed` | `boolean` | True if the media was assumed/defaulted because detection wasn't available and no override was provided. The consuming app MUST communicate this to the user, e.g.: "Preview may differ from print — select media or connect printer for accurate result." |
| <a id="property-media"></a> `media` | [`MediaDescriptor`](MediaDescriptor.md) | The media used for this preview (detected, overridden, or defaulted). |
| <a id="property-planes"></a> `planes` | [`PreviewPlane`](PreviewPlane.md)[] | One entry per colour plane the printer would produce. |
