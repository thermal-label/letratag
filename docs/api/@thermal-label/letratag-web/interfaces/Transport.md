# Interface: Transport

A bidirectional byte channel to a printer.

Implemented by `@thermal-label/transport` for each transport type
(USB, TCP, WebUSB, Web Bluetooth). Drivers program against this
interface and never touch platform APIs directly.

## Properties

| Property | Modifier | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| <a id="property-connected"></a> `connected` | `readonly` | `boolean` | Whether the transport is currently connected. |

## Methods

### close()

```ts
close(): Promise<void>;
```

Close the connection.

Always safe to call multiple times. Always `await` the result.

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`void`\>

***

### read()

```ts
read(length: number, timeout?: number): Promise<Uint8Array>;
```

Read bytes from the printer.

Buffers until `length` bytes are available or the timeout fires.

BLE implementations: there is no "read N bytes" primitive in BLE.
Implementations must buffer incoming GATT notifications internally
and satisfy `read()` calls from that buffer. Document this in your
transport class — every BLE implementation must handle buffering
consistently so drivers get the same pull-based API on every
transport.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type |
| ------ | ------ |
| `length` | `number` |
| `timeout?` | `number` |

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`Uint8Array`\>

#### Throws

TransportTimeoutError on timeout.

#### Throws

TransportClosedError if the transport is closed mid-read.

***

### write()

```ts
write(data: Uint8Array): Promise<void>;
```

Send bytes to the printer.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type |
| ------ | ------ |
| `data` | `Uint8Array` |

#### Returns

`Promise`\<`void`\>
